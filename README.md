This Github repository contains the files accompanying the manuscript "Historical GIS Database of Early 19th Century US Postal Routes" by Samuel Crowell
from his time as a PhD Candidate at Vanderbilt University. Any use of the files should be properly cited.

The accompanying repository contains two relevant shapefiles used for analysis in GIS software.

1) post_road_1796 contains the shapefiles that create the digitized postal routes.
2) post_route_cities contains the locations of the post towns along these routes.

Shape files with historical boundaries can be downloaded from https://data2.nhgis.org/main .

Additional files include:
1) petitions sent to congress, digitized by Blackhawk, et. al (2020).
